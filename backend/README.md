## 🔐 Backend

The backend of SanyDesign is powered by **NestJS** with **TypeScript**, providing a robust RESTful API connected to a **PostgreSQL** database through **Prisma ORM**. Image uploads and storage are handled via **Cloudinary**, ensuring optimized delivery and management. Project, service, tools and faq data are served securely to the frontend, enabling smooth interactions and dynamic content rendering.

The backend ensures fast, reliable, and maintainable operations, supporting project showcases, service listings, and technology overviews. With NestJS and Prisma, the application is scalable, secure, and ready for future enhancements.
